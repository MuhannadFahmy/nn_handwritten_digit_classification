# nn_handwritten_digit_classification

In this project, we developed multiple neural network architectures for classifying handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset using TensorFlow and Keras. The dataset was divided into training and testing subsets, where the images were preprocessed by normalizing pixel values to improve model performance.

# Technologies Used:

TensorFlow: Core library used to design and implement the neural networks.
Keras: A high-level API for TensorFlow, used for building model layers.
Matplotlib: Visualized sample images and confusion matrices for model evaluations.
NumPy: Assisted with data manipulation and reshaping for input compatibility.
Skills Learned:

Model Design with Sequential and Functional API: We explored two ways of creating models: the Sequential API, which provides a linear stack of layers, and the Functional API, which enables more complex architectures.
Training and Evaluation: Developed an understanding of training neural networks, evaluating performance, and optimizing hyperparameters.
Confusion Matrix Analysis: Applied confusion matrix to assess prediction accuracy and identify areas for improvement.
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs): Built a CNN for digit classification that showed significant accuracy improvements by capturing spatial hierarchies in the image data.
Conclusion: This project demonstrated the effectiveness of neural networks for image classification, achieving high accuracy (up to 98.6%) with the CNN model. By experimenting with various architectures and optimizers, we gained insights into model optimization and performance tuning, laying the groundwork for future work in deep learning-based image recognition.
